# Git Push After Edits

After making any code changes from a user prompt:

1. **Stage** all changes: `git add .`
2. **Commit** with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main` (or the current branch)

Do this by default unless the user explicitly asks not to push, or the project has no git repository.
